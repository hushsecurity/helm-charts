# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## hush-agw 0.2.0 - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- pass Hush standard environment variables to vector.

- bump the app version to v0.4.0.

  Consent methods work again against the current Hush backend; on v0.3.0 the
  user is offered nonsense choices. Tool definitions are cached per user, so one
  user's identity can no longer reach another's. A token that expires within the
  minute the gateway still honours is no longer refused, removing a common
  spurious 401.

## hush-agw 0.1.1 - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- bump the app version to v0.3.0. The chart remains otherwise unchanged.

## hush-agw 0.1.0 - 2026-08-13

### Added

- initial release of the Hush Security Agent Gateway chart
