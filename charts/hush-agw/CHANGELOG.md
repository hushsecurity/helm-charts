# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- add an `app.kubernetes.io/component` label to the gateway's Deployment,
  Service, ServiceAccount and PersistentVolumeClaim, naming the role each plays,
  and to the Deployment and Service selectors, so the objects can be selected by
  role rather than by name.

  Upgrading a release installed with an earlier version fails with
  `spec.selector: Invalid value: ...: field is immutable`, because a Deployment's
  selector cannot change once the Deployment exists. Delete the Deployment and
  run the upgrade again, or uninstall and install again under the same release
  name and namespace. The volume claim survives either way, so no state is lost.

## hush-agw 0.2.0 - 2026-08-31

### Changed

- pass Hush standard environment variables to vector.

- bump the app version to v0.4.0.

  Consent methods work again against the current Hush backend; on v0.3.0 the
  user is offered nonsense choices. Tool definitions are cached per user, so one
  user's identity can no longer reach another's. A token that expires within the
  minute the gateway still honours is no longer refused, removing a common
  spurious 401.

## hush-agw 0.1.1 - 2026-08-13

### Changed

- bump the app version to v0.3.0. The chart remains otherwise unchanged.

## hush-agw 0.1.0 - 2026-08-13

### Added

- initial release of the Hush Security Agent Gateway chart
